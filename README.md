This template uses the new Next.js App Router. This includes support for enhanced layouts, colocation of components, tests, and styles, component-level data fetching, and more.

## Getting Started

During the deployment, Vercel will prompt you to create a new Postgres database. This will add the necessary environment variables to your project.

Inside the Vercel Postgres dashboard, create a table based on the schema defined in this repository.

Run the following commands to start the development server:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

You should now be able to access the application at [http://localhost:3000].
